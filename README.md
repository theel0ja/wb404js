# wb404js

Currently it just uses default github pages 404.html page to load a static
page which checks Wayback Machine for last snapshot and shows a link.

## TODO

- [ ] make it work with loading immediately
    - [ ] read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh
- [ ] with option make it load with timeout
